# Agent permissions

Available on: Antigravity App, Antigravity CLI

Antigravity uses a unified fine-grained permission engine to evaluate sensitive tool operations across Deny, Ask, and Allow access lists. If you are using Antigravity with Gemini Enterprise, see [Antigravity in Gemini Enterprise](/docs/enterprise#autonomous-tool-permissions-and-human-in-the-loop-controls).

## Antigravity App

### Updated permission settings

Antigravity uses a robust, unified permission engine to secure your environment while enabling autonomous workflows. Every sensitive operation the agent performs is represented as a **permission resource** formatted as `action(target)`.

Permissions are evaluated across three distinct access lists:

*   **Deny**: The action is blocked immediately.
*   **Ask**: The agent pauses and prompts for your explicit approval before proceeding.
*   **Allow**: The action is allowed without prompting.

Note

**Precedence rule**: Conflicting rules are strictly evaluated in priority order: **Deny > Ask > Allow**. For example, if you configure `command(*)` in Ask and `command(git)` in Allow, the Ask rule takes precedence and prompts before every command.

#### Permission presets

The **permission preset** controls how agent actions are approved. Your configured allow, deny, and ask rules are layered on top of the preset and always take precedence:

| Preset | [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox) | Terminal Commands | File Access | MCP & Web |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Request Review** | Disabled | Always ask | Workspace only | Ask |
| **Default** _(default)_ | Enabled | Allowed in sandbox; ask outside | Workspace + temp dirs | Ask |
| **Auto** | Enabled | Allowed in sandbox; checked automatically outside | Workspace + temp dirs | Ask |
| **Turbo** | Disabled | Allowed (unrestricted) | Full filesystem | Allowed |

The two presets that use the sandbox work as follows:

*   **Default** (_“Ask before sensitive operations.”_; default): Terminal commands run inside the isolated **[Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox)** with access restricted to your workspace and temp directories and **no network access**. When a command needs network connectivity or host resources, the agent requests to run it outside the sandbox—prompting for your approval unless covered by a `command(...)` allow rule.
*   **Auto** (_“Automatically decide if commands run.”_): Commands also run inside the terminal sandbox by default. When a command needs to run outside the sandbox, Antigravity automatically evaluates it so safe, reversible commands run without prompting, while risky or irreversible commands still ask for your approval.

Refer to **[Agent settings](/docs/agent-settings)** for more detail on each preset.

Note

**Default** is selected by default (**Request Review** if the [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox) isn’t available). **Auto** (shown as **Auto (Preview)** in version 2.29.0 and earlier) is available in `v2.23.0+` on macOS and Linux and `v2.26.0+` on Windows when the sandbox is available. It isn’t currently available for business or enterprise accounts, including [Antigravity in Gemini Enterprise](/docs/enterprise).

#### Change your permission preset

You can set a preset for all projects, override it for a single project, or switch presets from the message box.

##### For all projects

To change the preset for all projects, open **Settings** > **General** > **Global Permissions** > **Permission Preset** (**Permissions** > **This Computer** if remote agents are available to you):

![The Permission Preset list open under Global Permissions in Settings > General, with Default checked and the options Request Review, Default, Auto, and Turbo](/assets/image/docs/permissions-preset-settings.png)

The checkmark marks your current global preset.

##### For a single project

To override the global preset for a single project, change the project’s preset under **Settings** > **Projects**. New projects default to **Inherit Global**, which follows your global preset.

##### From the message box

In `v2.23.0+`, you can also choose a preset from the permissions picker in the message box:

![The permissions picker open above the message box, with Default checked and the options Request Review, Default, Auto, and Turbo](/assets/image/docs/permissions-composer-picker.png)

The picker changes your global preset, or the project’s preset if the project overrides it. To remove a project override, choose **Use Global Settings**.

#### Supported actions and matching rules

The following table lists the supported permission actions, their target formats, and their default behavior:

| Action | Target Format | Default Fallback |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `read_file` | `read_file(/path)`, `read_file(dir)`, or `read_file(*)` | **Ask** (Allowed in workspace) |
| `write_file` | `write_file(/path)` or `write_file(*)` | **Ask** (Allowed in workspace) |
| `read_url` | `read_url(domain)` or `read_url(*)` | **Ask** |
| `execute_url` | `execute_url(domain)` or `execute_url(*)` | **Ask** |
| `command` | `command(prefix)`, `command(regex:pattern)`, or `command(*)` | **Ask** (Allowed in sandbox under the Default and Auto presets) |
| `mcp` | `mcp(server/tool)`, `mcp(server/*)`, or `mcp(*)` | **Ask** |

Each action matches its target as follows:

*   **`read_file`**: Matches absolute paths or paths relative to project workspace roots. Grants recursive read access to all contained files and folders. Using `read_file(*)` matches all files on the system.
*   **`write_file`**: Same as `read_file`. Implicitly grants `read_file` for the exact same target path.
*   **`read_url`**: Matches hostnames and subdomains (for example, `google.com` covers `mail.google.com`). Ignores URL path segments. Using `read_url(*)` matches any domain.
*   **`execute_url`**: Covers the browser subagent opening a page on a domain, for example when it navigates to a URL or opens a new page. Matches hostnames and subdomains and ignores URL path segments. A `read_url` grant doesn’t cover it.
*   **`command`**: Matches by exact word or token prefix literally by default. To match by regular expression, start the target with the `regex:` prefix (each whitespace-separated token is evaluated as an anchored regular expression `^(?:pattern)$`, for example, `command(regex:npm run (build.*))`). Covers execution both inside and outside the sandbox.
*   **`mcp`**: Matches exact MCP tools or all tools on a specified server (applies equally to local and remote MCP servers). Using `mcp(*)` matches any tool.

Note

**Global wildcard syntax (`*`)**: Across all supported action types (such as `read_file(*)`, `command(*)`, and `mcp(*)`), passing the global wildcard `*` matches all targets within that entire action namespace.

##### When commands require an exact match

Certain shell constructs can hide arbitrary command execution behind an otherwise benign prefix—for example, command or process substitution (`$(...)`, backticks, `<(...)`), arithmetic contexts (`$((...))`), brace expansion (`{a,b}`), non-literal command names, network or file descriptor redirections, and developer-tool flags that execute subcommands (such as `git -c core.pager=<cmd>` or `tar --to-command`). When Antigravity detects any of these (or cannot cleanly parse the command), it disables prefix matching for the entire command line: the command runs without prompting only if a rule matches the full line **character-for-character** (or across the full raw line for `regex:` rules), and otherwise falls back to **Ask**.

Standard shell composition still prefix-matches normally: pipelines, `&&`/`||`/`;` chains, quoted literals, plain `$VAR` arguments, simple file redirects, and transparent wrappers (`timeout`, `nohup`, `nice`, `env`, whose inner command is evaluated on its own). For example, with `command(git)` in your Allow list, `git status && git log` runs without prompting, while `git log $(whoami)` prompts for approval.

##### Understanding read\_url and execute\_url across the platform

Antigravity checks `read_url` and `execute_url` in three areas:

1.  **Web page reading**: When the agent fetches web page Markdown for research, it checks your `read_url` grants.
2.  **Browser subagent**: When the browser subagent opens a page, it checks your `execute_url` grants for that domain, not `read_url`. For details, refer to [Allowlist and denylist](/docs/ide/allowlist-denylist).
3.  **Terminal sandboxing**: Any domain granted under `read_url` is compiled directly into the sandbox’s outbound network allowlist, permitting commands like `curl` or `npm` to connect to authorized hosts.

##### Cross-platform command and path matching

Antigravity ensures your permission rules work consistently whether you’re developing on macOS, Linux, or Windows. On macOS and Linux, paths use standard forward slashes (`/`). On Windows, Antigravity automatically normalizes paths prior to rule evaluation by stripping drive letters (for example, `C:`) and converting all backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`).

#### Implicit permission rules

Antigravity applies the following implicit permission rules:

*   **Write implies read**: Allowing `write_file` on a path automatically grants `read_file` on that path.
*   **Deny read implies deny write**: Denying `read_file` on a path immediately blocks `write_file` on that path.

#### Interactive permission prompts

When the agent encounters an operation requiring approval (**Ask** mode), an interactive card appears in your editor. Before clicking **Allow** for file, URL, or MCP permissions, you can directly edit the target string in the prompt card to expand the granted scope (for example, broadening a single file request like `/project/file.txt` to the parent directory `/project`). Antigravity validates that your edited target safely covers the operation and applies the expanded grant for the remainder of the turn, preventing repeated prompts for related operations. _(Note: Scope editing isn’t supported for terminal commands)._

#### Terminal commands and the sandbox

Under the **Auto** and **Default** presets, the agent runs terminal commands inside an isolated [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox), which by default has access only to your workspace and system temp directories, and no network access. Commands can run without manual approval in the sandbox, and your permission grants can further shape what the sandbox can reach:

*   Paths granted under `read_file` dynamically populate the sandbox’s read-only filesystem allowlist.
*   Paths granted under `write_file` dynamically populate the sandbox’s read-write filesystem allowlist.
*   Domains granted under `read_url` define outbound network access policies.

Because some commands cannot run in the sandbox—for example, those requiring network access—the agent can still choose to run commands outside the sandbox:

*   **Default** _(default)_: Commands outside the sandbox prompt for your approval unless already allowed or denied by a `command` rule.
*   **Auto**: Antigravity automatically evaluates commands that need to run outside the sandbox so safe, reversible commands proceed without prompting, while risky or irreversible commands still require approval.

#### Default system behaviors and guardrails

When an action isn’t explicitly listed in your Allow, Deny, or Ask lists, Antigravity falls back to secure system defaults:

1.  **Commands**: Under the **Default** preset, commands run without prompting inside the sandbox and require approval to run outside it. Under **Auto**, safe commands outside the sandbox run without prompting, while sensitive or irreversible commands pause for approval.
2.  **Workspace files**: Reading and writing files inside your active project directory is allowed without prompting, while non-workspace files require approval.
3.  **Web browsing defaults to Ask**: Actions for `read_url` and `execute_url` default to **Ask**. Before the agent reads or opens a web page, it pauses and prompts for your explicit approval unless an allow rule is configured.
4.  **MCP tools default to Ask**: Unconfigured MCP tool calls prompt for approval.

Note

Explicit rules always take precedence over defaults. An Ask rule such as `command(rm)` prompts for approval even when the command would otherwise run without prompting in the sandbox.

#### Configuration examples

The following examples show rules for the **Allow list**, which defines actions that run without prompting:

```text
command(git)                             # Standard git commands
command(regex:npm run (build|lint|test)) # Allow safe npm scripts using regex
command(git push)                        # Allow git push, inside or outside the sandbox
read_file(/var/log/app)                  # Read external log paths
write_file(src/)                         # Edit relative src/ folder
read_url(google.com)                     # Fetch Google subdomains
mcp(linter/*)                            # Run linter MCP tools
```

The following examples show rules for the **Deny list**, which defines actions that are permanently blocked:

```text
command(rm -rf)                    # Block destructive deletions
command(regex:curl .*)             # Block unvetted curl downloads
command(sudo)                      # Block sudo privileges
write_file(.git/)                  # Safeguard Git history
write_file(/home/user/.ssh)        # Safeguard SSH keys
```

The following examples show rules for the **Ask list**, which defines actions that pause for manual confirmation:

```text
command(*)                         # Prompt all commands
execute_url(aws.amazon.com)        # Prompt before opening AWS pages
mcp(sql/execute_mutation)          # Prompt modifying SQL queries
```

### Previous permission settings

Note

Business and enterprise accounts use the permission system described in this section.

Antigravity uses a robust, unified permission engine to secure your environment while enabling autonomous workflows. Every sensitive operation the agent performs is represented as a **permission resource** formatted as `action(target)`.

Permissions are evaluated across three distinct access lists:

*   **Deny**: The action is blocked immediately.
*   **Ask**: The agent pauses and prompts for your explicit approval before proceeding.
*   **Allow**: The action is allowed without prompting.

Note

**Precedence rule**: Conflicting rules are strictly evaluated in priority order: **Deny > Ask > Allow**. For example, if you configure `command(*)` in Ask and `command(git)` in Allow, the Ask rule takes precedence and prompts before every command.

#### Supported actions and matching rules

The following table lists the supported permission actions in the previous permission settings, their target formats, and their default behavior:

| Action | Target Format | Default Fallback |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `read_file` | `read_file(/path)`, `read_file(dir)`, or `read_file(*)` | **Ask** (Allowed in workspace) |
| `write_file` | `write_file(/path)` or `write_file(*)` | **Ask** (Allowed in workspace) |
| `read_url` | `read_url(domain)` or `read_url(*)` | **Ask** |
| `execute_url` | `execute_url(domain)` or `execute_url(*)` | **Ask** |
| `command` | `command(prefix)`, `command(regex:pattern)`, or `command(*)` | **Ask** |
| `unsandboxed` | `unsandboxed(prefix)`, `unsandboxed(regex:pattern)`, or `unsandboxed(*)` | **Ask** |
| `mcp` | `mcp(server/tool)`, `mcp(server/*)`, or `mcp(*)` | **Ask** |

Each action matches its target as follows:

*   **`read_file`**: Matches absolute paths or paths relative to project workspace roots. Grants recursive read access to all contained files and folders. Using `read_file(*)` matches all files on the system.
*   **`write_file`**: Same as `read_file`. Implicitly grants `read_file` for the exact same target path.
*   **`read_url`**: Matches hostnames and subdomains (for example, `google.com` covers `mail.google.com`). Ignores URL path segments. Using `read_url(*)` matches any domain.
*   **`execute_url`**: Covers the browser subagent opening a page on a domain, for example when it navigates to a URL or opens a new page. Matches hostnames and subdomains and ignores URL path segments. A `read_url` grant doesn’t cover it.
*   **`command`**: Matches by exact word or token prefix literally by default. To match by regular expression, start the target with the `regex:` prefix (each whitespace-separated token is evaluated as an anchored regular expression `^(?:pattern)$`, for example, `command(regex:npm run (build.*))`).
*   **`unsandboxed`**: Matches command prefixes word-by-word literally by default (or with `regex:`). Commands matching this grant execute outside container isolation when terminal sandboxing is enabled.
*   **`mcp`**: Matches exact MCP tools or all tools on a specified server (applies equally to local and remote MCP servers). Using `mcp(*)` matches any tool.

Note

**Global wildcard syntax (`*`)**: Across all supported action types (such as `read_file(*)`, `command(*)`, and `mcp(*)`), passing the global wildcard `*` matches all targets within that entire action namespace.

##### When commands require an exact match

Certain shell constructs can hide arbitrary command execution behind an otherwise benign prefix—for example, command or process substitution (`$(...)`, backticks, `<(...)`), arithmetic contexts (`$((...))`), brace expansion (`{a,b}`), non-literal command names, network or file descriptor redirections, and developer-tool flags that execute subcommands (such as `git -c core.pager=<cmd>` or `tar --to-command`). On Windows shells like PowerShell or Command Prompt, commands whose syntax cannot be cleanly split into separate words also fall into this category. When Antigravity detects any of these, it disables prefix matching for the entire command line: the command runs without prompting only if a rule matches the full line **character-for-character** (or across the full raw line for `regex:` rules, such as `command(regex:git .*)`), and otherwise falls back to **Ask**.

Standard shell composition still prefix-matches normally: pipelines, `&&`/`||`/`;` chains, quoted literals, plain `$VAR` arguments, simple file redirects, and transparent wrappers (`timeout`, `nohup`, `nice`, `env`, whose inner command is evaluated on its own). For example, with `command(git)` in your Allow list, `git status && git log` runs without prompting, while `git log $(whoami)` prompts for approval.

3.  **Terminal sandboxing**: In sandbox mode, any domain granted under `read_url` is compiled directly into the container’s outbound network allowlist (`AllowedDomains`), permitting commands like `curl` or `npm` to connect to authorized hosts.

##### Cross-platform command and path matching

Antigravity ensures your permission rules work consistently whether you’re developing on macOS, Linux, or Windows. On macOS and Linux, paths use standard forward slashes (`/`). On Windows, Antigravity automatically normalizes paths prior to rule evaluation by stripping drive letters (for example, `C:`) and converting all backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`).

#### Implicit permission rules

Antigravity applies the following implicit permission rules:

*   **Write implies read**: Allowing `write_file` on a path automatically grants `read_file` on that path.
*   **Deny read implies deny write**: Denying `read_file` on a path immediately blocks `write_file` on that path.

Antigravity validates that your edited target safely covers the operation and applies the expanded grant for the remainder of the turn, preventing repeated prompts for related operations. _(Note: Scope editing isn’t supported for terminal commands)._

#### Terminal sandboxing (preview)

Permission grants also apply to commands when the sandbox is enabled:

*   Paths granted under `read_file` dynamically populate the sandbox’s read-only filesystem allowlist.
*   Paths granted under `write_file` dynamically populate the sandbox’s read-write filesystem allowlist.
*   Domains granted under `read_url` define outbound network access policies.

Note

Refer to **[Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox)** for architecture, preset configurations, and security details.

#### Default system behaviors and guardrails

When an action isn’t explicitly listed in your Allow, Deny, or Ask lists, Antigravity falls back to secure system defaults:

1.  **Commands default to Ask**: Unconfigured terminal commands (`command` and `unsandboxed`) require manual approval unless configured to run without prompting in your settings.
2.  **Workspace files**: Reading and writing files inside your active project directory is allowed without prompting, while non-workspace files require approval.
3.  **Web browsing defaults to Ask**: Actions for `read_url` and `execute_url` default to **Ask**. Before the agent reads or opens a web page, it pauses and prompts for your explicit approval unless an allow rule is configured.
4.  **MCP tools default to Ask**: Unconfigured MCP tool calls prompt for approval.

Note

Explicit rules always take precedence over defaults.

#### Configuration examples

The following examples show rules for the **Allow list**, which defines actions that run without prompting:

```text
command(git)                             # Standard git commands
command(regex:npm run (build|lint|test)) # Allow safe npm scripts using regex
unsandboxed(git push)                    # Allow git push outside sandbox
read_file(/var/log/app)                  # Read external log paths
write_file(src/)                         # Edit relative src/ folder
read_url(google.com)                     # Fetch Google subdomains
mcp(linter/*)                            # Run linter MCP tools
```

The following examples show rules for the **Deny list**, which defines actions that are permanently blocked:

```text
command(rm -rf)                    # Block destructive deletions
command(regex:curl .*)             # Block unvetted curl downloads
command(sudo)                      # Block sudo privileges
write_file(.git/)                  # Safeguard Git history
write_file(/home/user/.ssh)        # Safeguard SSH keys
```

The following examples show rules for the **Ask list**, which defines actions that pause for manual confirmation:

```text
command(*)                         # Prompt all commands
execute_url(aws.amazon.com)        # Prompt before opening AWS pages
mcp(sql/execute_mutation)          # Prompt modifying SQL queries
```

## Antigravity CLI

### CLI fine-grained permissions

To secure your workstation while enabling autonomous workflows, Antigravity CLI integrates a robust **fine-grained permissions engine**. Every sensitive operation the agent performs is represented as a **permission resource** formatted as `action(target)`.

Permissions are evaluated across three distinct access lists configured inside your global settings (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`):

*   **`deny`**: The action is blocked immediately.
*   **`ask`**: The agent pauses and prompts for your explicit approval before proceeding.
*   **`allow`**: The action is auto-approved without prompting.

Note

**Precedence rule**: Conflicting rules are strictly evaluated in priority order: **Deny > Ask > Allow**. For example, if you configure `command(*)` in your `ask` list and `command(git)` in your `allow` list, the `ask` rule takes precedence and prompts before every command.

### Supported CLI actions and matching rules

Fine-grained permissions follow a standard schema pattern:

```text
action(target)
```

The supported actions, target format specifications, and default fallbacks are listed in the following table:

| Action | Target Format | Default Fallback |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`read_file`** | `read_file(/path)`, `read_file(dir)`, or `read_file(*)` | **Ask** (Auto-allowed in workspace) |
| **`write_file`** | `write_file(/path)` or `write_file(*)` | **Ask** (Auto-allowed in workspace) |
| **`read_url`** | `read_url(domain)` or `read_url(*)` | **Ask** |
| **`execute_url`** | `execute_url(domain)` or `execute_url(*)` | **Ask** |
| **`command`** | `command(prefix)`, `command(regex:pattern)`, or `command(*)` | **Ask** |
| **`unsandboxed`** | `unsandboxed(prefix)`, `unsandboxed(regex:pattern)`, or `unsandboxed(*)` | **Ask** |
| **`mcp`** | `mcp(server/tool)`, `mcp(server/*)`, or `mcp(*)` | **Ask** |

The matching algorithm for each action is as follows:

*   **`read_file`**: Matches absolute paths or paths relative to workspace roots. Grants recursive read access to all contained files and folders. `read_file(*)` matches all files on the system.
*   **`write_file`**: Same as `read_file`. Implicitly grants `read_file` for the exact same target path.
*   **`read_url`**: Matches hostnames and subdomains (for example, `google.com` covers `mail.google.com`). Ignores URL path segments. `read_url(*)` matches any domain.
*   **`execute_url`**: Covers the browser subagent opening a page on a domain, for example when it navigates to a URL or opens a new page. Matches hostnames and subdomains and ignores URL path segments. A `read_url` grant doesn’t cover it.
*   **`command`**: Matches command prefixes word-by-word literally by default. If you want to use a regular expression, add the `regex:` prefix (for example, `command(regex:npm run (build|lint|test))`). Covers the command whether it runs inside or outside the terminal sandbox.
*   **`unsandboxed`**: Business and enterprise accounts only. Other accounts ignore `unsandboxed` rules and show a warning; use `command` instead. Matches command prefixes word-by-word literally by default (or with `regex:`). Commands matching this grant execute outside container isolation when terminal sandboxing is enabled.
*   **`mcp`**: Matches exact MCP tools or all tools on a specified server (applies to local and remote MCP servers). `mcp(*)` matches any tool.

#### CLI global wildcard syntax

Across all supported action types, passing the global wildcard `*` (such as `read_file(*)`, `command(*)`, and `mcp(*)`) matches all targets within that entire action namespace.

#### CLI implicit permission rules

Antigravity CLI applies the following implicit permission rules:

*   **Write implies read**: Allowing `write_file` on a path automatically grants `read_file` on that path.
*   **Deny read implies deny write**: Denying `read_file` on a path immediately blocks `write_file` on that path.

#### CLI cross-platform path normalization

Antigravity ensures your permission rules work consistently whether you’re developing on macOS, Linux, or Windows. On macOS and Linux, paths use standard forward slashes (`/`). On Windows, Antigravity automatically normalizes paths prior to rule evaluation by stripping drive letters (for example, `C:`) and converting all backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`).

#### CLI cross-platform command matching

On Windows shells like PowerShell or Command Prompt, commands that can’t be cleanly split into separate words require an exact match by default. To match a command and its subcommands on Windows, use the `regex:` prefix (for example, `command(regex:git .*)` to allow any `git` command).

* * *

### Default CLI system behaviors and guardrails

When an action isn’t explicitly listed in your `allow`, `deny`, or `ask` lists, the system falls back to secure system defaults:

1.  **Workspaces are auto-allowed**: In standard operation, reading and writing files inside your active project directory is automatically allowed (and approved without interactive diff prompts in `auto` and `accept-edits` modes).
2.  **Commands run in the sandbox in `auto` mode**: When `auto` mode is active, commands run inside the [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox) without prompting, and commands that need to run outside the sandbox are evaluated automatically so only risky or irreversible actions pause for approval.
3.  **Web browsing defaults to Ask**: Actions for `read_url` and `execute_url` default to **Ask**. Before the agent reads or opens a web page, it pauses and prompts for your approval unless an allow rule is configured.
4.  **Other unconfigured actions default to Ask**: Unconfigured `mcp` tools, non-workspace file access, and commands outside `auto` mode default to **Ask**, subject to your active execution mode and `toolPermission` setting.

### Execution modes and the terminal sandbox

Your fine-grained `allow`, `ask`, and `deny` rules always take precedence (`Deny > Ask > Allow`). For operations not covered by an explicit rule, Antigravity CLI evaluates your active [execution mode](/docs/cli/modes) (`--mode` or `agentMode` in `settings.json`) and `toolPermission` policy:

*   **`auto` mode (`--mode=auto` or `"agentMode": "auto"`)**: Automatically approves workspace file edits and runs terminal commands inside the [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox) by default. When a command needs to run outside the sandbox, Antigravity CLI automatically evaluates it so safe, reversible commands run without prompting, while risky or irreversible commands still pause for your approval. When active, the bottom-right status bar displays `auto` and the prompt placeholder reads `Auto mode: edits & safe commands auto-approved (shift+tab to cycle)`.
*   **`accept-edits` mode (`--mode=accept-edits`)**: Automatically approves workspace file edits and creations while continuing to evaluate shell commands against your `toolPermission` policy and fine-grained rules.
*   **`default` mode (default; select `default` in `/config`)**: Prompts for interactive diff review before modifying or creating files, and evaluates shell commands against your `toolPermission` policy (`request-review` by default).
*   **`toolPermission` overrides**: `strict` and `always-proceed` (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) take precedence over `auto` mode. Outside `auto` mode, `proceed-in-sandbox` runs sandboxed commands without prompting and asks before commands outside the sandbox. Starting in `v1.4.4`, if the sandbox isn’t available on your machine, `proceed-in-sandbox` behaves like `request-review` (refer to [Terminal sandbox](/docs/sandbox)).

Refer to **[Choose an execution mode](/docs/cli/modes)** for details on switching modes with Shift + Tab, `--mode`, or `/config`.

Note

The CLI starts in `default` mode (`request-review`) unless you choose another mode. `auto` mode is available in `v1.3.5+` on **macOS and Linux** and `v1.4.4+` on **Windows** when the terminal sandbox is available. It isn’t available for business or enterprise accounts.

### Interactive CLI permission prompts

When the agent encounters an operation requiring approval (**Ask** mode), an interactive prompt card appears in your TUI.

Before confirming **Allow** for file, URL, or MCP permissions, you can directly edit the target string in the prompt card to expand the granted scope (for example, broadening a single file request like `/project/file.txt` to the parent directory `/project`). The CLI validates that your edited target safely covers the operation and applies the expanded grant for the remainder of the turn, preventing repeated prompts for related operations. _(Note: Scope editing isn’t supported for terminal commands)._

### CLI configuration examples

Add these rules to your `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` file:

```json
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": [
            "command(git)",
            "command(regex:npm run (build|lint|test))",
            "read_file(/var/log/app)",
            "write_file(src/)",
            "read_url(google.com)",
            "mcp(linter/*)"
        ],
        "deny": [
            "command(rm -rf)",
            "command(regex:curl .*)",
            "command(sudo)",
            "write_file(.git/)",
            "write_file(/home/user/.ssh)"
        ],
        "ask": ["command(*)", "execute_url(aws.amazon.com)", "mcp(sql/execute_mutation)"]
    }
}
```
